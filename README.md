### Abastract
In the field of natural language processing, simple sentence has a great importance; especially for multiple choice question generation, automatic text summarization, opinion mining, machine translation and information retrieval etc. Most of these tasks use simple sentences and include a sentence simplification module as pre-processing or post-processing task. But dedicated tasks for sentence simplification are hardly found. Here we have proposed a novel system for generating simple sentences from complex and compound sentences. Our proposed system is an initiative for simplifying sentence by converting complex and compound sentences into simple ones. Along with this the system classifies the simple sentences of an input corpus from other types of sentences. To generate simple sentences from complex and compound sentences we have proposed a novel algorithm which takes the dependency parsing of the input text and produce simple sentences as output. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed technique is a promising one.
